---

The Dashboard displays a quick overall view of transactions on your HubRise Account. In a single view, you can see the last 30 day performance for completed sales, created orders, new customers, and revenue from those sales.

You can display information by Account, or narrow the results to a specific Location. For more information, see [Accounts and Locations](../gettingstarted/#accounts-and-locations).

Click the **SALES**, **ORDERS**, or **NEW CUSTOMERS** tabs to display the related content.
