  description: Informs users on how to Map POS Codes.

**PixelPoint Windows API** pushes but is not able to pull information stored in the **PAR PixelPoint EPOS**. For this reason, all menu items and prices must be **manually** set in the system to connect with their corresponding product code to ensure a smooth communication between HubRise and PixelPoint.

Every order received in **HubRise** is forwarded to the **EPOS** via the **PixelPoint Windows API**. Each request is saved locally in the server and can be inspected to find possible issues with the configuration.

For a detailed description of how to map the EPOS codes in the system connected to HubRise, see **Section** in **PixelPoint Bridge documentation**.

[comment]: # 'should we include there the exact same content we have on the HubRise Web API Bridge?'
