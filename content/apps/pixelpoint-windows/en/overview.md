## Description

**PixelPoint Windows API** is an app developed by Slowey Systems that allows the communication between **HubRise** and the **PAR PixelPoint EPOS**.

It takes any incoming order in HubRise, converts it into the PixelPoint format and sends it to the POS.

## Prerequisites

To establish a successful connection with your **PAR PixelPoint EPOS**, **PixelPoint Windows API** requires a server running in your store with the following apps:

- Windows OS [Comment]: # (Probably Win10? Check with John)
- Pixel SQLbase
- Pixel License Manager

PixelPoint Windows API also requires another server, managed by Slowey Systems, which is necessary to establish the connection between HubRise and the store server.
