## Description

Deliveroo is an online ordering and food delivery platform based in the United Kingdom but operating in 13 different countries in Europe, Asia, and Oceania.

Restaurants can benefit from Deliveroo's large pool of customers to grow their business and find new clients.
At the same time, they can concentrate on what they do best (preparing food) while letting Deliveroo take care of the logistics of food delivery.

## Prerequisites

To establish a connection between Deliveroo and HubRise, your restaurant must be a Deliveroo partner.

Deliveroo can connect to an existing or new HubRise account through the Deliveroo Bridge developed by HubRise.

## Why Connect?

Connecting your Deliveroo online restaurant to HubRise allows you to receive Deliveroo orders directly to your POS connected with HubRise.
You will be able to manage Deliveroo orders seamlessly from your existing setup, as you would do with all the other orders.
