To connect Deliveroo to HubRise, the Deliveroo team needs to log your HubRise location ID in their back office.
Don't worry, HubRise will take care of all the paperwork for you!

## Before Connecting Deliveroo

To start receiving Deliveroo orders on HubRise, you contact us at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) and include the following information in your email:

- The URL link(s) of your Uber Eats store(s) you wish to connect. For instance, [https://www.ubereats.com/ch/geneva/food-delivery/moshimoshi-carouge/CXJ6X53JQkqpZxAo9033EA](https://www.ubereats.com/ch/geneva/food-delivery/moshimoshi-carouge/CXJ6X53JQkqpZxAo9033EA).
- The email address you logged in the Deliveroo back office and use to communicate with Deliveroo.
- Your HubRise account and location IDs. If you have no HubRise Account, create one on the [HubRise Registration page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). If your restaurant called Fast Pizza is located in, your location ID might be something like Fast Pizza Baker Street z6q31-0.

We will then contact Deliveroo on your behalf to establish the connection and get you ready to receive orders.

[comment]: # (How can a restaurant get a location ID? 
Do they need to ask Deliveroo for it? If so, who should they contact? 
Or can they find it in the Deliveroo back office, how?)
