To connect Deliveroo to HubRise, the Deliveroo team needs to log your HubRise location ID in their back office.
Don't worry, HubRise will take care of this the paperwork for you!

## Send a request to HubRise

The first step to connect Deliveroo and send orders to HubRise is to contact us at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) and include the following information in your email:

- The URL link(s) of your Deliveroo store(s) you wish to connect. For instance, [https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/clapham/camile-thai-clapham](https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/clapham/camile-thai-clapham).
- The email address you logged in the Deliveroo back office and use to communicate with Deliveroo.
- Your HubRise account and location IDs. If you don't have a HubRise Account, go to the [HubRise Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup) and follow the instructions. If your restaurant called Fast Pizza is located in Baker Street, your location ID may be Fast Pizza Baker Street z6q31-0.

We will then contact Deliveroo on your behalf to establish the connection and get you ready to receive orders.

[comment]: # (How can a restaurant get a location ID? 
Do they need to ask Deliveroo for it? If so, who should they contact? 
Or can they find it in the Deliveroo back office, how?)
