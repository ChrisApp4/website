PixelPoint Bridge pushes but is not able to pull information stored in the PAR PixelPoint EPOS. For this reason, all menu items and prices must be manually set in the system to connect with their corresponding product code and ensure a smooth communication between HubRise and PixelPoint.

Every order received in HubRise is forwarded to the EPOS via the PixelPoint Bridge. For the transaction to work, products within the catalog, service types (delivery, collection, eat-in) and payment methods should be mapped. For a detailed description of how to map the EPOS codes in the system connected to HubRise, see [PixelPoint Bridge EPOS codes Mapping](/apps/pixelpoint/mapping-epos-codes).
