The Configuration page allows you to customise the behaviour of the foodpanda Bridge based on your preferences.
These are divided into different categories for an easier navigation.

## Customers

foodpanda does not share the customer's email address with the connected solutions. However, the name and phone number of the client are always present.

Therefore, in this section you can decide if you want to create a customer on HubRise when you receive an order, or if you prefer to use guest orders to avoid polluting your database with incomplete information.

This section allows also to specify a default email address that will be used for all your foodpanda orders.

## Service Types

This section allows you to specify the default ref codes used for foodpanda deliveries and collection by the customer.

## Delivery Charges

This section allows you to customise how the delivery charge will appear in your POS by specifying the ref code and the name.

## Payment

foodpanda customers can pay their order either online or by cash on delivery.

This section of the Configuration page allows you to specify the ref codes for these two payment methods.

## Saving the Configuration

Once you are happy with the configuration of the foodpanda Bridge, click **Save** at the top of the page to continue to the main page.

## Resetting the Configuration

You can always restore the Configuration page to its default values and change the foodpanda location ID associated with your HubRise location by clicking on **Reset the configuration** at the bottom of the page.
