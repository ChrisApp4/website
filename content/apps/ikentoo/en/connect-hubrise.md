## User Interface

The user interface for the iKentoo Bridge provides basic diagnostic information about your connection. It also provides a link to the logs of the latest HubRise requests sent to the POS.

### Main page

The main page of iKentoo Bridge displays the latest operations. Each row shows:

- **TIME**: The date and time of the operation.
- **STATUS**: The status of the operation. The value OK indicates that the operation has been successfull, otherwise a message will explain the type of error occurred.

Clicking on an row will open a new page displaying all the information about it.

On the top right corner of the iKentoo Bridge main page, the HubRise user and location connected are displayed, together with the iKentoo business location currently used. Clicking the down arrow <InlineImage width="28" height="21">![Down arrow icon](../images/001-arrow.jpg)</InlineImage> expands a menu where it is possible to change the language of the interface and to access the **Configuration page**.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The first time you access the logs from iKentoo Bridge, you will be asked to **Allow** the Bridge to access the information on your HubRise account.
