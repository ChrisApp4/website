## Menu Setup

This app is a _push-only_ integration, therefore iKentoo product and option codes must be copied manually from iKentoo into your menu.

### iKentoo Menu Export

You can find the codes from the iKentoo back-office. You may manually copy codes one by one from _Code_ field but you may find useful to export whole catalog.

- Open this URL in your browser: https://console.ikentoo.com/items/list (you may be asked to login with your iKento credentials)
- Click **Export** icon.
- In popup window choose your operation system type: Mac or Windows (or Manual configuration) and click **Export**
- Once export is done click **Click here to download the exported file** to download CSV file with your menu.
