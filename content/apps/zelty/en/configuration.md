Once your Zelty account is connected with your HubRise account, you can sync information between the services. Before information can be synced between the two platforms, there are, however, certain steps that need to be taken.

## Adding Products

Products can be set up in the Zelty backend using the main menu on the left, by navigating to **La Carte**, and then selecting **Les Produits**. On the top right hand corner of the page that opens, a toolbar appears. On the toolbar, click **+** which will take you to a page where a product can be created. 

Once a product is created it is added to the catalog. With a product in the catalog, the following steps can be taken:

* A subset of products, or **catalogue** can also be created, by navigating to **La Carte**, and then selecting **Les catalogues**. The difference between the whole menu and the subset will become apparent herein below. 
* A deal can be created by navigating to **La Carte**, selecting **Les menus** and clicking **Ajouter** on the page that opens.

## Catalog Import

The feature to import a catalog from HubRise to Zelty is unfortunately not available. It is, however, possible to export a catalog from Zelty to HubRise. 

In this regard, there are two options available:

* You can export the whole menu containing all the products. In order to export the menu, navigate to **Marketplace**, clicking on **Hubrise**, selecting the **GÃ©rer** option and selecting **Exporter ma carte vers HubRise** from the dropdown which appears.
* You can export a subset or **Catalogue** to HubRise. To do this, navigate to **Catalogues**. Next to the name of the subset, click the arrow and select **Envoyer vers**.

**Important Note:** The last option is currently not available, but it is coming soon.

In Zelty it is also possible to export all the reference codes in a **CSV** or **Excel** file. This includes the reference codes for Tags, Products, Menus and Options. 

In order to do this:

* Navigate to **La Carte**
* Select **Les Produits**
* In the toolbar that appear on the right, select **Exporter la carte**
* Select the options you require, the format, and make sure the final option is selected.

## Orders

Once HubRise is connected to Zelty no further steps are needed to activate order reception and orders are received by Zelty automatically.

Once you receive a new order, a notification will appear and the order will appear in the order list.

To view the order list:

* Navigate to **Tableau de bord**
* Select **Statistiques**   
* Selct the **Tickets** tab
