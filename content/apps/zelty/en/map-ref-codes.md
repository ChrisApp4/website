  title: Zelty - Mapping Ref Codes in HubRise
  description: 'Connect Zelty to the apps you use everyday: food ordering platforms, mobile apps, ordering sites, marketing and loyalty solutions, delivery services, and more.'
---

After connecting your Zelty EPOS to your HubRise account, you can sync information between them. For it to work however, certain steps need to be taken. Items in the Zelty EPOS are identified by unique codes. When you set up other apps to connect via HubRise, you need to provide these codes.

## Products, Menus and Options

If the other apps connected to your HubRise account cannot use HubRise catalogs, you will need to map ref codes manually.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: On the other hand, if you want to connect an app which supports importing catalogs from HubRise, you can fully automate the mapping process. To find out how, check the [Catalogs section](/apps/zelty/catalogs).

---

You will need to export the entire menu in an external file to find ref codes. They cannot be seen in the Zelty user interface.

To export the menu:

1. Navigate to **La Carte** (Menu).
1. Select **Les Produits** (Products).
1. In the toolbar that appear on the far right, select **Exporter la carte** (Export the menu).
1. Select the options you require, the format, and make sure the final option **Export pour les plateformes externes** (Export for external platforms) is selected.

The export includes ref codes for products, menus, and options, which you can manually enter in other systems.

## Payment Methods

Your Zelty EPOS offers various payment methods, including cash and online payment as well as client account.
It might be necessary to specify the corresponding payment method code for each payment method allowed in the system to connect via HubRise. You will need ask Zelty for it.

## Service Types

Each service type you provide (delivery, collection, eat-in) might need to be associated with the correct Zelty EPOS ref code on other apps connected to HubRise. The exact values of these codes depend on the particular setup of the restaurant. You will need ask Zelty for it.
