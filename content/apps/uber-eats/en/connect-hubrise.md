Don't worry, HubRise will take care of all the paperwork for you!

## Send a request to HubRise

The first step to connect Uber Eats and send orders to HubRise is to contact us at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) and include the following information in your email:

- The URL link(s) of your Uber Eats store(s) you wish to connect. For instance, ...
- The email address you logged in the Uber Eats back office and use to communicate with Uber Eats.

We will then contact Uber Eats on your behalf to establish the connection and get you ready to receive orders.
