App4 can be connected to HubRise for your site and other apps to work as a cohesive whole. It could be your EPOS, your loyalty systems, the kitchen display screen you use or your preferred marketing solution. This allows you to sync your menu, your customer and order information. For more information, see the [HubRise User Guide](/apps/hubrise). 

## Catalog Import

This allows you to import a HubRise Catalog into your App4 menu.  The following data is imported from HubRise to App4:

- Category and Product names.
- Product and Category assignments. (For example, if you have a Category for Beverages, and a Product Coffee in a HubRise Category, this import will assign Coffee into the Beverages Category).
- Images

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: This will not create new categories and products in App4. As of this time, this will only update existing categories and products.

To import a HubRise Catalog into App4 after App4 and HubRise have been connected, it will be necessary to contact App4 support, who will take the following steps:

1. Connect to your App4 back office.
1. Click **HubRise Settings**.
1. For the restaurant to sync, select **Sync Settings**.
1. Select from the following options:
    -  Move existing products into the imported categories.  This will update existing menu items into the categories imported from HubRise.  This will not create new products in App4: they must already exist first.
    - Update the product names: This will update existing product names in App4 to match the entries from HubRise.
    - Update imported category names: This will update existing category names in App4 to match the entries from HubRise.
    - Update existing images:  This will update the existing images in App4 to match the imports from HubRise.
1. When finished, click **Import**. This will import and update your restaurant's App4 menu based on the HubRise Category.

## Updating POS Codes

Depending on your EPOS, you will require product codes in your App4 products to successfully complete an order.
