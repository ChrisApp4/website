The instructions below detail how to connect an App4 site to a new HubRise Account. It is also possible to connect an App4 site to an existing HubRise Account.
At this stage it is not possible to make the connection manually and you will need assistance from the App4 support team.

To connect an App4 site to a new HubRise Account:

1. Login to your App4 back office.
1. Click **HubRise Settings**.
1. Select the restaurant to connect and click **Enable**.
1. Click **Link to HubRise Account**.
1. When the HubRise login page is presented, click **No Account Yet?** and fill in the required fields to create the account.
1. You will be prompted to create a new Account and Location. The **Account Name** should be the same brand name used in App4. The **Location Name** should be named after the city or street where the restaurant is. For more information, see [Create an Account on HubRise](/docs/account/#create-an-account) and [Create a Location on HubRise](/docs/locations/#create-a-location).
1. App4 will require permission to access your new HubRise Account and Location. When prompted, click **Allow** to complete the connection between your App4 site and your new HubRise Account.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Both App4 and HubRise have their own vocabulary, and may refer to the same things by different names. For example, the menu in App4 is a catalog in HubRise. For more information on the terms and definitions used between these two platforms, see [HubRise Definitions vs App4 Definitions](/apps/app4/app4-terms).
