## Description

App4 is an online ordering system that lets restaurant customers place orders from their browser, from an app, or from their table.  It provides a host of benefits to restaurants including:

- Loyalty programs.
- Delivery Management.
- Menu Management.
- Android and iOS apps branded for your business.
- Marketing tools.
- Reporting and Analytics tools.

With a robust back office system, you can manage multiple aspects of your restaurant’s menu, marketing strategy, delivery options and performance, and create reports to see how your strategies are paying off and where they need improvement.  App4 is integrated with a number of EPOS solutions, and provides you the ability to connect with HubRise for even more possibilities.

## Prerequisites

You can connect your existing App4 site to HubRise.  If you don’t have an App4 site yet, go to the [App4 Contact page](https://www.app4.co.uk/#callback) and arrange for one.

## Why Connect?

Connecting App4 to HubRise provides access to an ever expanding ecosystem of apps to increase your business.  Sharing customers between different apps, export or import your menu between platforms, and track your orders through one interface.  For more information, see the [HubRise User Guide](/docs).
