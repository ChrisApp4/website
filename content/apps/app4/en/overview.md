- Loyalty programs.
- Delivery Management.
- Menu Management.
- Android and iOS apps branded for your business.
- Marketing tools.
- Reporting and Analytics tools.

With a robust back office system, you can manage multiple aspects of your restaurant’s menu, marketing strategy, delivery options and performance, and create reports to see how your strategies are paying off and where they need improvement.  App4 is integrated with a number of EPOS solutions, and provides you the ability to connect with HubRise for even more possibilities.
