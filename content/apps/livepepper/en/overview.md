LivePepper can create a full site including static marketing pages and online ordering. Restaurants can also incorporate LivePepper’s online ordering module into an existing marketing website. Sites can be customised from a template, or designed from scratch and tailored to the restaurant specifications.

LivePepper comes with a rich palette of features including but not limited to:

*Deals
*Promotions

*Favorites list
*Multilingual user interface
*Google Maps integration

Restaurants have complete control over their LivePepper site. They can make changes to their menu, set up promotions, set business hours and vacation periods, delivery times, or other settings to best fit their needs.

LivePepper’s dashboard provides information on how the restaurant is operating, which can be exported into different formats for analysis or used in marketing campaigns.

LivePepper integrates seamlessly with all sorts of systems like traffic analysis, online advertising and conversion tracking.

LivePepper can be accessed by any standard web browser, and works from your desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
