## Description

Mailchimp Bridge is an app developed by HubRise that allows the communication between HubRise and Mailchimp. Mailchimp Bridge can forward a customer list to Mailchimp. This list can be forwarded at the time of connection and also when any new orders are placed or customers are added to your HubRise account. 

Mailchimp also provides a user interface from where you can send promotional and marketing materials to a single or a list of customers.

Mailchimp Bridge is a one-way connection from HubRise to Mailchimp (push only integration). This means that information only flows from HubRise to Mailchimp, not vice versa.

Therefore, Mailchimp Bridge cannot transfer customer data from Mailchimp to HubRise.

## Prerequisites

To establish a successful connection between your HubRise account and your Mailchimp account, you require an active HubRise account and an active Mailchimp account.

## Why Connect?

Mailchimp can be connected to your HubRise account to enable you to easily send marketing, promotional and other communications to your customers.
