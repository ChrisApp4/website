TastyCloud provides management of multiple branches from a single back office. These branches can be connected to a HubRise Location, sharing menu, orders, and customer information with HubRise.

The instructions below detail how to connect TastyCloud to an existing HubRise Account.  For information on how to create your HubRise user profile and Account, see the [HubRise User Guide](https://www.hubrise.com/apps/hubrise/). 

In order to connect your HubRise account to your TastyCloud site, you should contact your TastyCloud support representative. They will assist you with the integration of your HubRise Account to your TastyCloud site.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: At this stage, the integration of a HubRise Account to a TastyCloud site can only be performed by TastyCloud's support team, but an automated process for all users will be available soon.
