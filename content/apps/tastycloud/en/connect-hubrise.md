TastyCloud provides the management of multiple branches from a single back office. These branches can be connected to a HubRise Location, which enables the sharing of menu, orders, and customer information with HubRise.

The instructions below detail how to connect TastyCloud to an existing HubRise Account.

1. Create your HubRise user profile and Account. For instructions, see [Create a User Profile](/docs/getting-started/#create-a-user-profile).
1. Give support@tastycloud.fr permission to access your HubRise Account. For instructions, see [Add a User Permission](/docs/permissions/#add-a-user).
1. Contact your TastyCloud support representative and share your HubRise Account name and unique identifier. They will assist you with the integration of your HubRise Account to your TastyCloud site.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: At this stage, the integration of a HubRise Account to a TastyCloud site can only be performed by TastyCloud's support team, but soon users will be able to do it autonomously.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: TastyCloud cannot simultaneously connect an EPOS and HubRise. Once your TastyCloud site is connected to HubRise, your EPOS will necessarily be connected via HubRise. To see available EPOS solutions on HubRise, check our [Apps](/apps) page.
