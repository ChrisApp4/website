## Description

TastyCloud is an online ordering solution.  With it, your customers can order delivery or take-out from your own personalized site.  You can keep track of each customer and communicate with them through marketing programs, social networking and other essential tools.

TastyCloud integrates with your existing website and your Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking systems. Your customers seamlessly transition from looking at your delicious food to ordering it on their smartphones, tablets, or desktop web sites.

TastyCloud lets you set your hours of operation and delivery, lets you change your menu on the fly, and offer alternatives.  Are your customers craving vegan or paleo or other options?  You can make that easy for them to find so they can order with full confidence in your service.

## Prerequisites

To create a connection between TastyCloud and HubRise, you must have an existing TastyCloud site and HubRise Account. You can register for a free demo TastyCloud account through the [TastyCloud website](www.tastycloud.fr), or set an appointment to work with their experts to help guide you through the process.

If you donâ€™t have an existing HubRise Account, you can register one in just a few minutes on the [HubRise Signup page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup).
