## Description

TastyCloud is an online ordering solution for restaurants. With it, your customers can order delivery or collection from your own site on their smartphones, tablets, or desktop computer from anywhere at anytime. At the restaurant, your customers can view the menu on a variety of screen types. They can also use a self ordering kiosk, order at the table on your hardware or scan a QR code to see your menu and order directly from their smartphone.

TastyCloud integrates with your existing marketing website and your Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking systems. Your customers can seamlessly transition from looking at your delicious food to ordering it.

TastyCloud lets you set your hours of operation and delivery, lets you change your menu on the fly, and offer alternatives. Are your customers craving gluten free, vegan or other options? On a TastyCloud system, you can make it easy for them to find these.

## Prerequisites

To create a connection between TastyCloud and HubRise, you must have an existing TastyCloud site and HubRise Account. You can register for a free demo of the TastyCloud site through the [TastyCloud website](www.tastycloud.fr).
