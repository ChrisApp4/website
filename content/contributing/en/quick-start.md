## Introduction

This guide provides instructions for when you want to contribute your documentation to the HubRise documentation. It provides instructions on style guide specifications, spelling, style and technical documentation.

The goal of the documentation is to provide technical assistance in respect of your app and its integration into the HubRise platform. Therefore, it should be written in sufficient detail in order to impart the necessary information to the reader.

An example of proper documentation can be found [here](/apps/livepepper/connect-hubrise).

## Process

The documentation will be written in Markdown and managed/stored stored on a GitHub repository. We use Docker and Webstorm but you are welcome to use any IDE you feel most comfortable with. WebStorm is a good option if you have no preference.

For review the HubRise internal team will suggest modifications by editing the markdown and make comments on Github Issues.
Once the documentation is considered final, its content will be published and connected to the HubRise Apps page on our corporate website.

Our documentation is not literature, we should reuse as much of the existing content as we can and copy the structure from one app to the other.

## Style

All contributions to the HubRise documentation should be made with a certain style. This style of writing determines what language to use, the tone and the specifications for technical writing. For the necessary requirements, we use the [Style Guide](/contributing/style-guide).

The [Style Guide](/contributing/style-guide) provides information on, for example:

> - Punctuation
> - Capitalisation
> - Readability
> - References
> - Headings and Titles, etc.

For further guidance on the style, please refer to the [Style Guide](/contributing/style-guide).

## Screenshots

When it becomes necessaryto supplement your documentation with screenshots, these screenshots have to comply with certain technical specifications. Our [Screenshots Guide](/contributing/screenshots-guide) provides guidance on these specifications.

For more information on how to use screenshots in your documentation, please refer to the [Screenshots Guide](/contributing/screenshots-guide).

## Videos

When it becomes necessaryto supplement your documentation with videos, these videos have to comply with certain technical specifications. Our [Videos Guide](/contributing/video-guide) provides guidance on these specifications.

For more information on how to use screenshots in your documentation, please refer to the [Videos Guide](/contributing/video-guide).
