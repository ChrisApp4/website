## Introduction

The HubRise corporate website includes various types of technical documentation and guides. This guide on how to contribute provides instructions on how to contribute to the documentation. Should the need arise to contribute, we have published our Style Guide and separate guides on how to use Screenshots, Diagrams and Videos in your contributions as reference. As outlined in more detail herein below, any proposed contributions will be reviewed to confirm that these contributions are made in terms of the aforesaid guides.    

<!-- I have not included the below -->

<!-- Technical documentation types we publishe:

- The HubRise public API. Link to it?
- The HubRise User Guide. Link to it?
- Small HubRise native apps User Guides. We have only OrderLine for now. Link to it? -->

For every app for which an integration with HubRise exists, technical documentation will be created. This technical documentation includes an overview of the app, what the integration does, how to connect and how to troubleshoot issues. 

Some of the apps on our Apps page which we have already documented include:
* [dotdigital](#) 
* [LivePepper](/apps/livepepper)
* [AquilaCMS](/apps/aquila)
* [PAR Pixel Point web API](#) 

[comment]: # 'this section is to be updated as more HubRise technical documentation is published'

The goal of all the documentation is to:

- Provide the information needed to integrate HubRise with a specific app and make it as user friendly as possible.
- Provide users and engineers with information and assistance on how to use the HubRise platform.
- Provide technical assistance in respect of app integrated into the HubRise platform.
- Help users and developers to troubleshoot any issues that may arise when using or connecting with the HubRise platform.
- Answer any frequently asked questions.

<!-- I have not included this as it is, to a large extent contained in what is stated herein above.  -->
<!-- This documentation helps to:

- ensure transparency, anyone should be able to understand what can or cannot when connecting with another app via HubRise.
- troubleshoot recommendations are given to help
- respond to frequently asked questions. -->

We always attempt that the documentation provides sufficient detail to give all the necessary information to the reader but there is always a margin for improvement. Therefore, if you spot an error or if you have a simple suggestion for improvement do not hesitate to let us know about it.

## Contributors

Anyone is welcome to contribute in improving technical documentation and help us achieve our goals. Editors of integrated apps are pro-actively encouraged to contribute but any HubRise users or stakeholders are welcome to give feedback. Motivation to contribute varies. It could be:

<!-- - a simple feedback to readers giving attention to detail -->
- to make users of connected apps more autonomous
- to help support teams troubleshoot any issues that may arise
- or to document frequently asked questions and avoid answering the same questions over and over again.

## Process

On the [Apps](/apps) page, **click** on the icon for the app which will take you to the page for the app. For example, if you click on the icon for [LivePepper](/apps/livepepper), you will be taken to the Overview page for [Livepepper](/apps/livepepper).

When you are on a technical documentation page, scroll down to the bottom. At the bottom of the page, you will find the **Feedback on this page** link. Click on the link which will open a dropdown list of options.

A simple email can be sent but all our technical documentation is available in a public repository. If you are familiar with GitHub you can edit the page yourself and submit a **Pull Request**. The documentation has been written in **Markdown**.

## Style

The HubRise documentation follows a certain editorial style. 

The editorial style is defined in a Style Guide which sets out the specifications to use when writing. These specifications include, but is not limited to, the language to use and the tone but also capitalisation, punctuation and much more. This guide is complemented with a Glossary of Terms to define spelling decisions and clarify the meaning of certain recurrent terms we use. For further guidance on the editorial style to use, please refer to the [Style Guide](/contributing/style-guide) and the [Glossary of Terms](/contributing/glossary-of-terms).

When it becomes necessary to supplement your documentation with screenshots, these screenshots have to comply with certain technical specifications. For more information on screenshots and related file naming convention, refer to the [Screenshots Guide](/contributing/screenshots-guide) .

You can also include videos. These videos have to comply with certain technical specifications. To find out more, refer to the [Videos Guide](/contributing/video-guide).
