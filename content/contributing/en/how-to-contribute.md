## Introduction

The HubRise corporate website includes various types of technical documentation. This contributors guide provides instructions on how to give us feedback. We will review any feedback you submit but be we have published our style guide specifications, terminology preferences and iformation on how to create screenshots, diagrams or short videos for reference.

Technical documentation types we publishe:

- The HubRise public API. Link to it?
- The HubRise User Guide. Link to it?
- Small HubRise native apps User Guides. We have only OrderLine for now. Link to it?
- For every app for which an integration with HubRise exists, a technical documentation will be created, including an overview of the app, what the itegration does, how to connect and how to troubleshoot issues. Link to the Apps page and confirm which apps we have already documented? dotdigital, LivePepper, AquilaCMS, PAR Pixel Point web API. On the [Apps](/apps) page, **click** on the icon for the app which will take you to the page for the app. For example, if you click on the icon for [LivePepper](/apps/livepepper), you will be taken to the Overview page for [Livepepper](/apps/livepepper).

[comment]: # 'this section is to be updated as more HubRise technical documentation is published'

The goal of all the documentation is to:

- Provide the information needed to integrate and make it as easy as it can be.
- Provide users and engineers help on how to use our platform.
- Provide technical assistance in respect of app integrated into the HubRise platform.

This documentation helps to:

- ensure transparency, anyone should be able to understand what can or cannot when connecting with another app via HubRise.
- troubleshoot recommendations are given to help
- respond to frequently asked questions.

We try to write it in sufficient detail to give all the necessary information to the reader but there is always a margin for improvement. Therefore, if you spotted an error or if you have a simple suggestion for improvement do not hesitate to let us know about it.

## Contributors

Anyone is welcome to contribute in improving technical documentation and help us achieve our goals. Editors of integrated apps are pro-actively encouraged to contribute but any HubRise users or stakeholder is welcome to give feedback. Motivation to contribute varies. It could be:

- a simple feedback to readers giving attention to detail
- to make users of connected apps more autonomous
- to help support teams troubleshoot
- or to document frequently asked questions and avoid answering the same questions over and over again.

## Process

When you are on a technical documentation page, scroll down to the bottom. At the bottom of the page, you will find the **Feedback on this page** link. Click on the link which will open a dropdown list of options.

A simple email can be sent but all our technical documentation is available in a public repository. If you are familiar with GitHub you can edit the page yourself and submit a **Pull Request**. The documentation has been written in Markdown.

## Style

The HubRise documentation follows a certain editorial style. Graphics, diagram and video visual representations and technical specification are also defined in this contributing guide to maximise consistency throughout the site.

The editorial style is defined in a style guide which clarifies rules to use when writing. Not only the language to use and the tone but also capitalisaiton and much more. This guide is complemented with a Glossary of terms to define spelling decisions and clarify the meanining of certain recurrent terms we use. For further guidance on the editorial style to use, please refer to the [Style Guide](/contributing/style-guide) and the [Glossary of Terms](/contributing/glossary-of-terms).

When it becomes necessary to supplement your documentation with screenshots, these screenshots have to comply with certain technical specifications. For more information on screenshooting and related file naming convention, refer to the [Screenshots Guide](/contributing/screenshots-guide) .

You can also include videos. These videos have to comply with certain technical specifications. To find out more, refer to the [Videos Guide](/contributing/video-guide).
